# Global-Superstore-Analysis


Just wrapped up my second data analysis project, and I'm excited to share it with you all!
I’ve been working on an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using python from Akash More where I drove deep into understanding the Global Superstore dataset, digging into customer behavior, shipping trends, product performance, and market insights. From identifying top-performing segments to analyzing sales and discount patterns — this was a great hands-on experience in understanding real-world business data.
It's been a valuable learning experience, and I'm looking forward to improving with every project I take on.
